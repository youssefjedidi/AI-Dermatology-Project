# --- A Note on pythonpath ---
# If your project is installed in editable mode (pip install -e .), you can
# often remove the pythonpath line entirely, as your src package is already
# on the path. However, keeping it is harmless and makes the project
# easier to run for contributors who might forget to install it.

# of your main.py which is not meant to be tested as a unit.

# Fail the test suite if the total coverage drops below a certain threshold.
# This is great for maintaining high test quality over time.
